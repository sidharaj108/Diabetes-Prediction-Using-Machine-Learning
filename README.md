🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning is a Python-based project that leverages medical data and machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes. By analyzing key health parameters such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, and family history, this system provides an intelligent prediction model to assist in early detection and awareness.

📊 Dataset

The project uses a structured dataset (e.g., diabetes.xlsx) containing medical and lifestyle features related to patient health. Typical features include:

Glucose Level

Blood Pressure

Body Mass Index (BMI)

Age

Family History

Outcome (Target Label: diabetic or non-diabetic)

Note: You may replace the placeholder dataset description with specifics from your actual Excel data.

🧠 Machine Learning Models

The model training is done inside the Jupyter notebook with steps that typically include:

Data Loading & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis

Feature Engineering & Cleaning

Model Training & Evaluation

Example models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.

Prediction on New Data

Feel free to update and extend these model choices as needed.

🛠️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:
